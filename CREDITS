   Guymager can be configured to use the famous libewf for writing EWF images
   and Guymager's own EWF module is based on Joachim's documentation. Without
   Joachim's work on the EWF format, the Guymager project would probably never
   have been started. Special thanks to Joachim as well for believing in the 
   idea of parallelised compression.

Michael Prokop <mika at debian.org>
   Mika took care of correctly packaging Guymager and making it available in
   the main repositories. Without him, the Guymager installation would have
   remained the nightmare it was before. As well, many thanks to Mika for his
   patience while answering my numerous questions about copyright and his
   suggestions for giving the sources a GPL compliant shape.

Erwin van Eijk <erwin.van.eijk at gmail.com>
   Erwin not only had many good ideas for new Guymager features, but also
   directly put them into working code which he shared in his feedbacks. Among
   others, the job queue, the user field and the running statistics are based
   on Erwin's work and ideas. Many thanks for this and for supporting the
   spirit of open source.

Wilhelm Spiegl
   Software is only as good as it has been tested. Willi always played an
   important role in this. Many thanks for his persistent testing and
   detailed problem documentation. If Guymager is said to be stable
   and user friendly it's because of Willi's unwearied work.

Trevor Welsby
   Thanks to Trevor, Guymager has a few bugs less and includes some new
   features (SHA1 support and relative paths). Trevor submitted his bug reports
   and feature requests together with suggestions for source code changes and
   thus made the necessary changes in the main trunk really easy.
